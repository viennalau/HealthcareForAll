# Healthcare For All
A project worked on during/after the STEM Pathways x TISP Biology and Machine Learning hackathon. I collaborated in a team of two with Leen Attia. Started August 2023 and revisited in November 2023 for completion.

Leen worked on the Heart Rhythm Classifier part of the website, using the Teachable Machine with Google platform. She utilized a training set from Kaggle which contained audio files of various heartbeats. She also created the website as a whole, utilizing HTML and CSS.

I worked on the Health Quiz, which consists of a 20-item form with various symptoms. I trained an AI model with a dataset that contained thousands of data points, containing those 20 symptoms and a 0/1 under it. The last column in the dataset describes the person's sickness, depending on the symptoms. The four sicknesses were COVID-19, the flu, the common cold, and allergies. If you'd like more information, check out the Health Quiz tab on the website or the code itself!
